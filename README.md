# Overview:  <br />
To make a basic website that can record a users input using a process I'm comfortable with. This website will record what a person says and display it on the screen.  <br />

# Limits:
    <ul>
        <li> Automatically remove any instance that is recorded on the 5th spot </li>
        <li>Have >3 Pages</li>
        <li>Don't over do it</li>
        <li>Have a clean and presentable look</li>
        <li>Have decent UI and UX</li>
        <li>Use minimalist style (No images/Video ect.)</li>
    </ul>
